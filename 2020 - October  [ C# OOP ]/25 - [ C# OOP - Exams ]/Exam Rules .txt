1. Unit testing 
- Add reference
- Live Unit Testing

[SetUp]
public void SetUp()
{
    
}

[Test]
public void Test2()
{
    Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() =>
    this._robotManager = new RobotManager(-10));
}

- When you send your solution
- Open Structure sln 
- Open Structure Description
- Check after 1-2 minutes for Unit testing result in Judge

2. Structure
- You have to have a pencil and a piece of paper
- Open all files to look what you have given from skelet
- Open StartUp and look for all code
- Look IController
- When you look all code then open description and start reading from line 0 to end
- Read it slow, because if structure is not ok => business logic is not ok too

- Copy method text and paste in visual studio ( /*  */)
- Step by step solved the problems
